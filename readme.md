**Synopsis:**

This project implements three programming katas written in python:

- Bowling Game: http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/
- Game of Life: http://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/
- Minesweeper: http://codingdojo.org/kata/Minesweeper/

All katas were completed according to the requirements
presented on the Coding Dojo pages. Any modifications to those requirements are noted in the 
module docstring of the .py file for the particular project.

At the time of this submission, Minesweeper is the only project that contains a slight modification.

## Tests
All unit tests are contained in the "test" directory. The minesweeper and game of life projects read some of the input from the folders that are also included in that directory. Running the tests is as easy as:
 ```
 python test/{TESTNAME}
 ```
